TestðŸŽ¤ testðŸŽ¤

Alright. The new design seems to be working.

I decided to start this website during my PhD studies and I just wanted something for listing my publications and sharing my work.
But I was (and still am) a web design dummy.
I didn't know a thing about web design, so I used the [Academic Pages template](https://academicpages.github.io/) as it covers what I wanted and looks good.
After a while though, I wanted to make some changes in the design such as changing colours or adding a Twitter widget.
I tried to dabble in the code of the template, but it turned out to be huge and quite complex for a newbie like myself.
So, DIY, right? Or in my case, do it with the help of ChatGPT and Google Bard, and a loooot of stackoverflow.
I'm using GitLab pages to host the website, so I also had to learn the basics of Jekyll, and I used this [tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB) as well as [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for that.
This is how I ended up creating this new minimalist design with a simple code.

I will explain the structure of the website and how to use it in this post.
You can find the code on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io) and [GitHub](https://github.com/HaririAli/personal-site).
P.S. If you are an expert, and you find something stupid in the code, go easy on this newbie :D 

### How to use this website template
The website is powered by Jekyll and follows the typical structure of Jekyll websites.
You can refer to the tutorial or docs for a detailed description of the structure. In this post I will only outline the files that you need to modify to use this template.

#### _data/author.yml <a href="https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/blob/main/_data/author.yml"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>


This file contains all information about the site author such as the name, bio, and social media handles.
The information in this file are then used by the code to be displayed on the website.

#### _data/metadata.yml <a href="https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/blob/main/_data/metadata.yml"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>
This file is used to store metadata about the website.
So far I used it to set the date of the last modification of the website, and the links to the website repositories on the GitLab and GitHub.

#### _data/nav.yml <a href="https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/blob/main/_data/nav.yml"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>
This is used to specification the items of the navigation menu list you see at the top.
If you want to a new page or a link to an external site/page in your navigation menu, you only need add the title and URL to this file.
If the navigation item you are adding refers to an external page/site, you have to write the full URL.
Otherwise, if your new navigation menu item refers to a page on this website, then you only need to add a relative link.
For example, note how the URL to the Blog page is `/blog/`.

```yaml
- title: Blog
  url: /blog/
```

#### _data/publications.yml <a href="https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/blob/main/_data/publications.yml"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>
This where you store information about your publications to be listed on the publications page.
For each publication you must specify the title, venue, date, abstract, authors, and the file name of the publication.
You also need to specify the type of each author in the authors list.
If the type is set to "author", then the name will be displayed in bold in the list of publications.
This is intended to highlight the website authors' names in the authors' names of the publications.
The file name is used to serve the actual file of the publication such as a PDF.
I will explain later where to store these files.

#### _pages/index.md <a href="https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/blob/main/_pages/index.md"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>
This is where you write the contents of the home page.
You can also add other pages in the [_pages](https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/tree/main/_pages) directory.
You can then add links to them in the navigation menu as described above.
Pages must be written either in HTML or in markdown.
For each page you must specify the title and the layout in the front matter at the top.
The `layout` variable refers to the HTML layout file you want to use to display the page.
Refer to the Jekyll docs or tutorials to learn more about this.
You can also set the `permalink` variable to specify a custom path to the home page.

Example:
```yaml
layout: page
title: Home
permalink: /
```

#### _posts <a href="https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/tree/main/_posts"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>
Add your blog posts in this directory.
You can write them either in HTML or in markdown.
For each post you have to specify the post title, date, layout, author, and read time.
Right now, `layout: post` is the only available layout, but you can define a new design layout in the [_layout](https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/tree/main/_layout) directory.
Refer to the docs of tutorials for know-how.
You can also define a custom link to your blog posts by setting the `permalink` variable.
This is optional though.
The `excerpt` variable is optional too, but you can use to specify a short extract of the post to appear on the list of posts.

Example:
```yaml
title: Post title
date: 2023-09-17 
permalink: /custom/link/
layout: post
author: author name
read-time: 5-minute
excerpt: short text to appear in the list of posts.
```

#### _sass/_variables.scss <a href="https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/blob/main/_sass/_variables.scss"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>
This where the CSS variables of the website are defined.
It includes colours, fonts, font sizes, margins, etc.
You can modify these variables to change the design of the website.

Example:
```css
$background-colour: #121212;
$header-colour:     #1D1D1D;
$font-colour:       #FFFFFF;
$accent-colour:     #8CBA86;
```

#### files <a href="https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/tree/main/files"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>
You can add files to be served by your website in this directory.
The PDF files of your publications must be added under the [files/publications](https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/tree/main/files/directory)directory.

#### images <a href="https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/tree/main/images"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>
Use this directory to store images to be served by your website including the avatar.
The file name of the avatar stored in this directory must be added to the [_data/author.yml](https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/blob/main/_data/author.yml) file as described above.
You can also refer to images stored under this directory in your blog posts to display them in posts.
Example you can add this to a post to display an image:

```html
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="/images/path/filename.jpg"/>
</div>
```

#### _config.yml <a href="https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/blob/main/_config.yml"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>
Finally, use this file to set site configurations such as the site name and URL.
You add other Jekyll configurations in this file.
Refer to the docs and tutorials for more details.

### Hosting the website
You can host this website on GitLab using [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/) by simply modifying the contents and adding them to a repo on GitLab.
The website should be up and running few minutes after pushing your code, unless of course you have something wrong in your code.
The link to the website would be `https://<repo-name>.gitlab.io`.
You can also host it on GitHub using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) by creating a repo and pushing the code.
The repo name must be in the following format: `<your username>.github.io`.
The site should be up and running few minutes after pushing your code.

I also a [Dockerfile](https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/blob/main/Dockerfile) and [docker-compose.yml](https://gitlab.com/HaririAli/haririali.gitlab.io/-/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) files to run and host the website locally using Docker.
You only need to build the image and start the docker container using the docker-compose file.
Make sure the docker-compose file uses the same image name you build.

Example:
```commandline
docker build -t <image-name> .
docker compose up
```
