    Efforts have been made to improve the security of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, but there remain some
    vulnerabilities and misimplementations. This paper describes a new threat to home security devices in which an
    attacker can disable all functionality of a device, but to the device’s owner, everything still appears to be
    operational. We targeted home security devices because their security is critical as people may rely on them to
    protect their homes. In particular, we exploited a feature called “heartbeat”, which is exchanged between the
    devices and the cloud in order to check that the devices are still connected. Even though network traffic was
    encrypted, we successfully identified the heartbeats due to their fixed size and periodic nature. Thereafter, we
    established a man-in-the-middle attack between the device and the cloud and selectively forwarded heartbeats while
    filtering out other traffic. As a result, the device appears to be still connected (because the heartbeat traffic is
    being allowed through), while in reality the device’s functionality is disabled (because non-heartbeat traffic is
    being filtered out). We applied this exploit on a set of six devices, and five were found to be vulnerable.
    Consequently, an intruder can use this exploit to disable a home security device and break into a house without
    the awareness of the owner. We carried out a responsible disclosure exercise with the manufacturers of the affected
    devices, but the response has been limited. This shows that IoT security is still not taken completely seriously
    and many threats are still undiscovered. Finally, we provide some recommendations on how to detect and prevent the
    threats posed by insecure IoT devices, which ironically include IoT home security kits.

    Access control has been traditionally used to protect data and privacy. Traditional access control models
    (e.g., ABAC, RBAC) cannot meet modern security requirements as technologies spread over heterogeneous and dynamic
    environments that need continuous monitoring. Modern models such as Usage Control (UCON) introduced the concept of
    continuous authorisation that has a lifecycle consisting of a series of phases through which the authorisation
    passes during its lifetime. However, such models assume a fixed lifecycle for all authorisations, so they cannot
    satisfy emerging technologies (e.g., smart vehicles, zero-trust, data flow), which require various and fine-grained
    lifecycles. Researchers have extended existing models to meet such requirements, but all solutions remain
    restrictive, as they are specially tailored for specific use-cases. In this paper, we propose an extensible model
    for continuous authorisations and usage control. The model enables its users to customise and dynamically configure
    the authorisation lifecycle as required by the use-case. This adds a layer of abstraction, forming a metamodel that
    can be instantiated into different flavours of continuous authorisation models, each addressing specific
    requirements. We also show that the authorisation lifecycle can be modelled as Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)
    and expressed in a structured language used by an evaluation engine to dynamically enact and manage the lifecycle.
    We layout the building blocks of the proposed metamodel and devise future research directions.

    The automotive industry is witnessing an accelerated growth in digital innovations that turn modern vehicles into
    digital systems. This makes the security of modern vehicles a crucial concern as they have evolved into
    cyber-physical and safety-critical systems. Therefore, stateful identity management and continuous access control
    have become a paramount requirement in smart vehicles. Indeed, several Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    frameworks have been proposed in the automotive field, but context awareness and continuity of control remain
    overlooked. To address these challenges, we present SIUV: a stateful smart-car IAM that is based on Usage Control
    (UCON) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). SIUV uses Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) policies to issue
    privileges to subjects (i.e. drivers or applications) according to their credentials and claims. The issued
    privileges are then used to decide whether to grant or deny access to in-car resources. Furthermore, the system
    continuously monitors subject claims, resource attributes and environmental conditions (e.g. location or time).
    Hence, if a change occurs, the system re-evaluates policies and updates or revokes issued privileges and usage
    decisions accordingly. We describe the architecture of SIUV, discuss the evaluation results, and define future
    directions.

    In highly dynamic and distributed computing environments (e.g., Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, edge),
    robust access and usage control of assets is crucial. Since assets can be replicated in various locations on
    heterogeneous platforms and dynamic networks with unknown or partially authenticated users, the need for a uniform
    control mechanism is essential. The theory of Usage Control (UCON) is an example of such a mechanism to regulate
    access and usage of resources based on expressive polices and a loosely-coupled enforcement technology. However,
    in complex socio-technical systems, concerns about scalability, performance, modularity often arise, and existing
    UCON models and frameworks cannot meet such requirements. To tackle these concerns, we introduce UCON+, an
    improvement over existing UCON models, which adds continuous monitoring before granting and after revoking
    authorizations as well as policy administration and delegation. This chapter aggregates our recent contributions
    on the conceptual, architectural, and implementation level of UCON+, and provides a comprehensive reference to
    describe the current state-of-the-art and the novelties of UCON+.

      This paper introduces a new model for handling data privacy throughout data lifecycle via the introduction of a
      policy profile using the ALFA policy language. Our approach extends previous models in three complementary ways:
      (1) By introducing Administration and Delegation Profile (ADP) in ALFA policy where users and companies can
      restrict the scope of access/usage policies related to data as well as specify a chain of custody for data
      (moreover such an approach eases up the tasks of handling users’ consent); (2) Thanks to our framework Usage
      Control System Plus (UCS+) users can monitor the usage of data and revoke its usage upon specific conditions or
      at will; (3) By introducing new states for policy evaluation, i.e. Admissible/NotAdmissible to filter out those
      applicable policies that were unauthorized in the first place.

    Wi-Fi connectivity, a necessity in this digital era, requires careful infrastructure planning and tuning during
    installation. In this paper, we propose “Aparecium Wi-Fi Planner”, an open-source and cross-platform, Wi-Fi planning
    software tool based on an enhanced empirical path loss model. The proposed “Enhanced Solah's model” delivers more
    accurate results than existing models. And hence, “Aparecium Wi-Fi Planner” accurately estimates path loss
    attenuation, absorption attenuation by obstacles and fading effect. Moreover, the tool integrates the design and
    development of several algorithms to find full-coverage and optimal access point location with reduced complexity.
    Aparecium has been thoroughly tested and validated using both simulation and real testbed scenarios.
