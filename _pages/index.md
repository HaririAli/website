### Welcome to my site!

Hello, I'm Ali, a cyber security researcher and a software engineer.
I specialise in data security and access/usage control, and I mostly use C++ and Python.

When I'm not working, I enjoy watching movies and series, cycling, or reading.
Photography is also one of my favourite hobbies so I try to capture the world as I see it. You can check out my photos on my [photography page](https://haririali.gitlab.io/photography/) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/{{ site.data.author.instagram }}).

Now I'm also exploring blogging here. Expect mostly technical posts and occasionally some random thoughts. Hope it will be informative/interesting for you.

Thanks for stopping by!
