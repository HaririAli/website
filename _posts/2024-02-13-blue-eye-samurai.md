Netflix occasionally — or accidentally as [Rick Sanchez put it](https://youtu.be/ZEt0vZU43h8) — produces good series.
[Blue Eye Samurai](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13309742/) is undoubtedly one of them.
I think it's a masterpiece that deserves your attention and should be on your watchlist!
Want to know why? Here is a spoiler-free breakdown :D

### Plot
Blue Eye Samurai is an animated action adventure drama series set in Edo-era Japan.
The story follows Mizu, a highly skilled samurai with piercing blue eyes and a tragic past, on a quest for revenge against a group of powerful people.
The series narrative is straightforward, but Mizu's treacherous and twisted path, mixed with his relentlessness and unwavering desire for vengeance, make the story so thrilling and captivating to watch.
Although Mizu forges unexpected alliances throughout his journey, he hits a lot of bumps and faces setbacks that unveil hidden truths, and challenge his rigid sense of justice and unwavering resolve.

### Theme
The main theme of the show is revenge and action, highlighting the destructive consequences of retribution and the devastating impact of violence.
While vengeance sets the stage, a mix of other themes is tossed in.
Politics, power and corruption are among the themes that are woven into the story.
The fight for freedom and overcoming personal limitations are also thrown into the mix, intersecting with aspects of feminism and gender stereotypes as characters shatter expectations and defy societal norms.
Although fictional, the show is also enriched with accurate historical references to Edo-era Japan, making it not only entertaining, but also educational (at least for me as I didn't know a thing about Edo-era Japan).

### Character Development
The series owes much of its success to the compelling character transformations and the intricate web that connects their fates.
Mizu initially appears remorseless and ruthless, but this facade melts away as the story unfolds, and he slowly allows himself to form connections and care for others.

The series' character development extends to the supporting characters, who challenge the main protagonist in intriguing ways, and are just as well-written.
We witness characters realising their true potential, forsaking superficial aspirations in favour of an aspiring greatness.
As characters transform into better versions of themselves, Blue Eye Samurai reminds us that even the weakest among us have crucial roles to play.

### Cinematography
The cinematography is an outstanding work of art.
The choreographic action sequences stand out as a spectacle, exhibiting authentic samurai swordplay.
Character emotions are rendered with nuanced detail evoking stronger engagement from the audience.
All in all, the animation captivates with its stunning visuals, gorgeous dresses and costumes, lively streets, and authentic architecture, creating an eye-catching and immersive visual experience.

### Episodes
The show consists of 8 episodes each lasting between 45 and 60 minutes.
Although a samurai story, don't expect non-stop action scenes.
Episodes are well-rounded and balance sword clashing with drama, adventure and even lighthearted comedic moments, providing enough time for character development and exploration of deeper themes.
Some episodes feature dialogue-free sequences that invite quiet reflection and immersion in the series' vibrant visuals.

Episode 5 stands out as a particular masterpiece in storytelling.
It offers a deeper look into Mizu's troubled past, revealing the secret ingredient that created such a vengeful and violent character.

The finale concludes the series with a sense of closure, yet manages to pique curiosity, which makes you wonder if they are secretly planning a second season.
I personally prefer it to end here though, because many shows have been ruined by additional seasons (cough, cough, Westworld!).
