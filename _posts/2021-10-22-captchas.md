Hello fellow humans! Hello bots!

This is my very first technical post. It's about CAPTCHAs. You don't have to solve them though. Bots are welcome to read too.

The Internet is obsessed with making sure we are not bots. You have probably struggled with solving CAPTCHAs to prove you are not a machine, but did you know that computers are actually better than us humans at solving them? Let us take a brief journey through the history of CAPTCHAs and learn about their origin, how they can be broken and why we still use them.

> Can machines think?

It all started with this question. In 1950, Alan Turing, the father of computers, devised a thought experiment he called "The Imitation Game". — yes, this is where [the movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/) gets its name from. — The objective of the imitation game (also known as the Turing Test) is to help answer the question of whether machines can think. The thought experiment describes a game played by two humans and a machine. One of the two humans is an examiner who has to figure out which of the other two is the machine, while the machine has to imitate a human to confuse the examiner. The examiner asks a series of questions to the other two players and tries to figure out which is which based on their answers. If he or she fails to distinguish between them, then the machine can be considered to have the ability of exhibiting intelligent behaviour similar to that of a human.

How is this related to CAPTCHAs? Well, the Turing Test is the basis of CAPTCHAs, and actually a part of their name, which stands for: *Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart*. CAPTCHA was created in the early 2000s to protect web services from malicious bots. It's a challenge that is supposedly easy for humans and difficult for computers. If the user can pass the challenge, then they are verified as a legitimate human user and allowed to use the service. CAPTCHA is described as a reverse Turing test, because the roles are reversed as the examiner is the web server, a machine not a human.

The very first forms of CAPTCHAs were ~~these annoying distorted and unclear little texts that users have to type in order to be authenticated~~. They were a success for a couple of years, but researchers proved that they can be easily broken using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. Web developers tried to make the challenges more difficult for bots by making the words more distorted and unclear, but ironically, this ended up being more difficult for us humans not computers.

After the failure of OCR-based CAPTCHAs, computer scientists developed other forms of CAPTCHAs in the late 2000s. A particularly interesting one was Microsoft's Asirra CAPTCHA. It shows a set of photos of cats and dogs and the user has to select all cat photos or all dog photos to prove they are a human. Interestingly, researchers found a very simple way to break Asirra CAPTCHAs using colour and texture analysis only. If the majority of colours in a photo are shades of blue and green, then it must be a photo of a dog, because dog owners take photos of their dogs mostly outdoors when they walk them. Otherwise, if the photo has more textures, then it must be a photo of a cat, because cat photos are typically taken indoors where there are more objects and edges. This colour- and texture-based classification of photos worked with an accuracy of ~83%.

The use of image-based CAPTCHAs started to grow quickly in the late 2000s, but breaking these CAPTCHAs started to get easier and easier, especially with the evolution and development of machine learning and AI. Web developers started to use more detailed or distorted images, but this only made CAPTCHAs more annoying and difficult for us humans.

CAPTCHAs are based on challenges that should be easy for humans and difficult for computers, so to make them unbreakable, we have to ask: what is something that humans can do, but computers cannot? The answer may be nothing! With machine learning, computers will probably be able to break any form of CAPTCHAs. This does not mean that CAPTCHAs are totally useless though. Not all hackers or programmers know how to use machine learning to break them, so they can still drastically lower the possibility of abusing web services. Besides, "half a loaf is better than none", right? Protecting websites with breakable CAPTCHAs is still better than nothing at all.
